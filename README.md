## Storyline

For over two thousand years, there existed an enormous and irreconcilable contradiction between China’s highly centralized authority under the prefecture-county system and the self-cultivator agricultural system. Faced with this contradiction, reform became an inevitable choice. Historical figures like Wang Anshi and Zhang Juzheng attempted such reforms, but only Emperor Yongzheng succeeded. Through thirteen years of vigorously implemented reforms, Emperor Yongzheng resolved this fundamental contradiction. However, his handpicked successor Qianlong gradually dismantled these new policies, a development that profoundly foreshadowed the inevitable collapse of the Qing Dynasty.

But what if the process of Emperor Yongzheng’s ascension to the throne had been altered—if he had not received support from his brothers or other ministers? Would everything have been different? Would he still have been able to secure that position?
